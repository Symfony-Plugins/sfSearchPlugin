sfSearch Repository
===================
This repository contains plugins that relate to the sfSearch system:

    core/           All sfSearch plugins depend on the core
    lucene/         Searches using Zend_Search_Lucene
    solr/           Searches using Apache Solr
    cached/         Searches using a cache layer
    propel/         Indexes Propel models
    doctrine/       Indexes Doctrine models
    symfony/        Indexes symfony actions

    bin/            Contains common scripts
    test/           Contains the test suite helpers

Each package exists as its own plugin.  There is no bloated sfSearchPlugin that
contains everything.

Notes for Users
---------------
If you are using the sfSearch system, be warned that this plugin is HIGHLY
unstable and has not even reached alpha testing!  To start using the plugin,
checkout the core into your project and read the documentation:

    $ cd /path/to/project
    $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfSearchPlugin/trunk/core plugins/sfSearchPlugin

Notes for Developers
--------------------
sfSearch provides a shell script to quickly get started with sfSearch
development.  Simply check the shell script out from the repository and use it
to initialize a development environment:

    $ cd ~
    $ svn export http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfSearchPlugin/trunk/bin/init-dev.sh
    $ mkdir sfSearch 
    $ cd sfSearch
    $ ../init-dev.sh

This sequence will create the file structure:

    sfSearch/
        search/
            core/
            lucene/
            solr/
            ...
        symfony/
            apps/
            ...
            plugins/
                sfSearchPlugin (symbolic link)
                sfLucenePlugin (symbolic link)
                ...

New search plugins may be committed to the sfSearch repository at any time.
However, please ensure that every plugin can stand on its own.  This means they
must have a README and LICENSE file, a lib and test directory, and possibly a
`package.xml' file for pear.
