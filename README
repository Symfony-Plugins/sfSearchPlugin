This repository contains many plugins that relate to the sfSearch system. When 
checking out sfSearch, write each plugin to its own directory.  

The core of sfSearch is located in the core/ directory.  To checkout the core,
we would execute:

    $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfSearchPlugin/core plugins/sfSearchPlugin

When checking out additional search plugins, we place them in its own directory:

    $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfSearchPlugin/lucene plugins/sfLucenePlugin
    $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfSearchPlugin/propel plugins/sfPropelSearchPlugin

New search plugins may be committed to the sfSearch repository at any time
However, please ensure that every plugin can stand on its own.  This means they
must have a README and LICENSE file, a lib and test directory, and possibly a
`package.xml' file for pear.
